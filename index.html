								<b>Arecibo REDS: The Stellar Activity of Stars with Potentially Habitable Planets</b><br>
								The stellar activity of red dwarf stars is of particular interest due to their potential to host 
								habitable planets around them. These planets could experience atmospheric erosion and be rendered 
								inhabitable if subject to frequent flaring activity; this activity is associated with detectable 
								radio emissions. We exploit the sensitivity of the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope to observe 
								nearby red dwarf stars with potentially habitable planets and study their flaring activity. 
								As a member of Arecibo REDS, I plan observing sessions and carry them out on-site, and reduce and 
								analyze data.

								<b>N-body Simulations of a Warm Jupiter Near Resonance with a Sub-Neptune</b><br>
								While very few hot Jupiters are known to have nearby planetary companions, warm 
								Jupiters with nearby small planets are much more common. Our team found an interesting 
								case of a warm Jupiter near resonance with an outer sub-Neptune. To further explore the 
								behavior of this configuration, I am programming dynamical simulations of this system to 
								test its stability and evolution. So far, I have found that the system can be stable within 
								the known constraints set by Kepler and radial velocity data, but I rule out many configurations 
								with high eccentricities (>0.15) or mutual inclinations (>5 degrees). 
								Check out my presentation below to learn more! <br>

								<b>Models of Data in Astronomical Interferometry</b><br>
								On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope team released their groundbreaking image of the 
								black hole Messier 87*. On what grounds do we conceive of this and other synthesized results of 
								astronomical interferometry as legitimate ‘pictures’, and what does it mean to say we ‘saw’ the 
								shadow of the black hole? In this project, I examine the tools and models modern philosophy can 
								provide to examine this and other astronomical results obtained through interferometry. Particularly, 
								I am constructing a data model for interferometric images, and exploring what recent work in the 
								philosophy of perception and the philosophy of shadows can tell us to inform how to most faithfully 
								communicate and present findings obtained through interferometry.

								<b>Radio OH Observations of the First Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov</b><br>
								Comet 2I/Borisov was first observed September 8, 2019 and was quickly identified as originating from 
								outside the Solar System due to its highly eccentric, hyperbolic orbit. This is the first interstellar 
								comet to be discovered so far. Radio observations of comets have been successfully performed since 1973, 
								when comet C/1973 E1 (Kohoutek) was observed in search of the hydroxyl (OH) radical in the comet’s coma; 
								the OH radical is a photodissociation product of water and can be used to quantify the water production 
								of the comet. Using the Arecibo Observatory, we observed 2I/Borisov over the course of its passage 
								through the northern sky, looking for this same OH signal. Though the campaign resulted in a non-detection, 
								our results are consistent with observations at other wavelengths, and future work includes obtaining 
								upper limits on water production from our data.

								<b>Circle of University Astrobiology</b><br>
								The Circle of University Astrobiology (CiAsU) at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus, is a 
								student organization for both science and non-science majors interested in astrobiology. We host several 
								projects at our campus such as micrometeorite hunts and campus flora geotagging, as well as activities such 
								as talks by astrobiologists and our famous Quantum Poetry Night. As Vice President of CiAsU, I help organize 
								the group and lead a project in which we are uncovering the history of the first ever astronomical observatory 
								of Puerto Rico, which sits abandoned and which we hope to restore. Check us out on 
								<a href=“https://www.facebook.com/CiAsUuu/“ target=“_bank”>Facebook</a> and

								<b>Community Participation in PHL Observations</b><br>
								The Planetary Habitability Laboratory invites students and community members to participate in our observations 
								at the Arecibo Observatory. As a PHL observer, I help bring interested people to our observations, offer them 
								talks about our projects and the workings of the telescope, give them tours of the control room, and show them 
								how the telescope is operated in real time. If you are in Puerto Rico and interested in participating, 
								shoot me an email!

								<b>Puerto Rico Science Policy Action Network</b><br>
								The Puerto Rico Science Policy Action Network (PR-SPAN) is a coalition of Puerto Rican scientists who advocate

								prepare the monthly PR-SPAN newsletter and contribute to advocating directly to policymakers.
