								<b>Arecibo REDS: The Stellar Activity of Stars with Potentially Habitable Planets</b><br>
								The stellar activity of red dwarf stars is of particular interest due to their potential to host 
								habitable planets around them. These planets could experience atmospheric erosion and be rendered 
								inhabitable if subject to frequent flaring activity; this activity is associated with detectable 
								radio emissions. We exploit the sensitivity of the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope to observe 
								nearby red dwarf stars with potentially habitable planets and study their flaring activity. 
								As a member of Arecibo REDS, I plan observing sessions and carry them out on-site, and reduce and 
								analyze data.

								<b>N-body Simulations of a Warm Jupiter Near Resonance with a Sub-Neptune</b><br>
								While very few hot Jupiters are known to have nearby planetary companions, warm 
								Jupiters with nearby small planets are much more common. Our team found an interesting 
								case of a warm Jupiter near resonance with an outer sub-Neptune. To further explore the 
								behavior of this configuration, I am programming dynamical simulations of this system to 
								test its stability and evolution. So far, I have found that the system can be stable within 
								the known constraints set by Kepler and radial velocity data, but I rule out many configurations 
								with high eccentricities (>0.15) or mutual inclinations (>5 degrees). 
								Check out my presentation below to learn more! <br>

								<b>Models of Data in Astronomical Interferometry</b><br>
								On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope team released their groundbreaking image of the 
								black hole Messier 87*. On what grounds do we conceive of this and other synthesized results of 
								astronomical interferometry as legitimate ‘pictures’, and what does it mean to say we ‘saw’ the 
								shadow of the black hole? In this project, I examine the tools and models modern philosophy can 
								provide to examine this and other astronomical results obtained through interferometry. Particularly, 
								I will construct a data model for interferometric images, and explore what recent work in the 
								philosophy of perception and the philosophy of shadows can tell us to inform how to most faithfully 
								communicate and present findings obtained through interferometry.
